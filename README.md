## Problem Description:
1. The input money is only one currency note at a duration which is
either 10 or 20 or 50 rupees.
2. When the total money inserted crosses the Maximum Retail
Price(MRP) the product is dispensed and the change is given back
to the customer.
3. When the total money inserted is less than the MRP and there is
no input money in the next duration the product is not dispensed
and the money inserted till the previous duration will be returned
to the customer.
4. The products available in the BLACK BOX are Chola samosa,
cold-drink and sandwich and their cost is 30,40 and 50 rupees
respectively.
5. The BLACK BOX can give any amount of change at any time.

## Explanation:
For the customer to buy the cold-drink, the process can go this way:
(This is one possible way and not the only way)
1. Initially, the BLACK BOX waits for the input and takes the input
after every duration.
2. The customer selects the product he wants to buy i.e. cold drink
and then inserts the notes in the fashion of 10 rupee notes, 20
rupee notes, and then 50 rupee notes.
3. Now the BLACK BOX dispenses the cold-drink and the change of
40 rupees as two 20 rupee notes or four 10 rupee notes etc.

## Task for round :
Design the circuit for the above BLACK BOX in Proteus.
-  The inputs to the BLACK BOX are as follows:
1. input(s) for selecting an item and
2. input(s) for inserted money (two bits)
-  The output of the BLACK BOX is as follows:
a) whether the purchase is successful or not and
b) the change (up to three bits).
- Use a logic probe showing whether the purchase is successful or
not (0 or 1).
- Use only D Flip Flop.
- Use the 7 segment display ( 7SEG-BCD IC in proteus) to
represent change in the circuit.
- Keep the clock frequency low (0.5 Hz) at the time of final
submission to have a better understanding of the working of the
design.
- Make the circuit clear and understandable (you can label the
name of the integrated circuits for easy understanding)

## General Rules:
1. All the participants caught in the plagiarism are disqualified
immediately without any hesitation.
2. One participant can be present in only one team otherwise the
participant and the teams in which she/he is present will be
disqualified.
3. The submissions will be accepted till 11:59 PM, 21-03-2021.
4. Any change in the rules, timings, marking scheme, etc will be
notified.
5. The organizers reserve the right to change the rules.
6. All the decisions taken by the organizers will be final and binding.
